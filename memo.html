            <p>
                From the moment you came into my life, everything felt brighter, softer, and warmer.  
                You are my werey, my safe place, and my priceless treasure.  
                I love the way you laugh, the way you care, and the way your heart feels like home to me.  
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter where life takes us, I promise to stand by you, lift you up, and love you to the best of my capacity.  
                You have been a blessing in my life, I really enjoy every moment with you even though its online, I pray we heal and grow to love ourselves the way we both deserve to be loved, I pray God keeps us, blesses us, grant us peace,  joy, laughter, money and increase our love, I LOVE YOU, and every day I thank the universe for you. ‚ù§
